#Â Multivalent Selection Engine

Welcome to the Multivalent Selection Engine repository. This project houses MATLAB scripts designed to simulate the selection processes of multivalent particles (used in "Evolution of Multivalent Supramolecular Assemblies of Functionalized Nucleic Acids with User-Defined Spatial Organization").

## About

This repository focuses on the computational modeling and simulation of multivalent particle selection using MATLAB. It aims to provide a robust framework for studying and visualizing complex selection mechanisms that are pivotal in various scientific fields.

Details about the algorithms, methodologies, and use cases will be added in future updates.
Features

    MATLAB-based simulation scripts.
    Customizable parameters for tailored simulation scenarios.
    Designed for scalability and reproducibility.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    MATLAB (Version 2022b or later is recommended)
    Dependencies: Any MATLAB toolboxes required will be listed in upcoming documentation.

Running the Scripts

    Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/VinceCar/multivalent_selection_engine.git

Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned folder.
Run the desired script:

    >> run('selection_engine.m')

Planned Updates

    Detailed documentation of the methodology.
    Additional scripts and sample datasets.
